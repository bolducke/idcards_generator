# ID Card Generator

## Motivation

For FoieGraph 2022, we needed to create IDCards for every member that were attending the event. Unfortunately, I didn't find any script to accomplish this task.
I decided to provide mny script so that anyone can inspire themself and do not waste time on this simple task.

## How does it works?

The formatting of every card is handle using `html` and `css`. In my template `template/page.htm`, I tried-and-failed the margin so that everyting would be correctly printed.

To begin, you need a template for your ID Card (Adobe Illustrator, By hands, etc...). Then, based on this template, you mark slots where you want to insert information. Finally, the filed cards are inserted into the main document.

You only need to print the html document generated. Most browser let you print the `html` page if you need it.
